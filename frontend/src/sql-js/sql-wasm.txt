The sql-wasm.d.ts and the sql-wasm.js
files are from https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js.

Both files are not in node_modules to be modified for the following reason:
Per default, the library (sql.js) is not compatible
with the current rollup configuration (rollup.config.js).

As the sql-wasm.js requires a hosted webassembly file,
this is hosted from the folder static/sql.js.
